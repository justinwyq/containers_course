kubectl cluster-info

on mac can do hard link: 
sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/kubectl k ??? doesn't work
alias k="/opt/homebrew/bin/kubectl"


To monitor the cluster: 
* octant: runs outside of the cluster, can save resources. depends on the permissions of the kubeconfig file
* kubecolor: runs inside the cluster


kubernetes shorthands:
po = pods
ns = namespace
k describe po/cilium-s8lz4 -nkube-system = k describe pods cilium-s8lz4 -n kube-system

kube-system: where most of the control plane components runs
any ns with -system at end: for managing control plane components
default: should not use this
kube-public: visible to all users, shouldn't use
