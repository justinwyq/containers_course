Doing a hostPath for volumes is a bad idea. It can fill up the host storage causing that node to crash.

To view storageclasses:
k get storageclass
or `k get sc`

PersistentVolumeClaim  (PVC) is namespace-scoped. Persistentvolume is not namespace-scoped

Can also get documentation via `k explain po.spec.volumes`
k explain po.spec.volumes.persistentVolumeClaim

# if storage class is retain, it's possible to create a new deployment to re-attach to the retained volume. however this must be done statically.
# used to have a 'recycle' storageclass but that has been deprecated.
